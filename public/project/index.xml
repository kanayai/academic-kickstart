      <description>Geographically demarcated clusters are the most common choice for cluster-randomised trials (CRTs). At the design stage, the clusters should ideally be sufficiently far apart to render spatial correlation negligible. This may be impractical, however, since some outcomes are correlated at the scale of tens of kilometres. Hence there may be a need for post hoc analysis taking the spatial distribution into account. We distinguish the following two effects:
 Spillover dependence: cross-cluster correlation between individual outcomes</description>

      <description>This project looks at developing new statistical models for time-to-event data analysis that exploit the analytical and numerical properties of an overlooked key function: the cumulative hazard function. These analytical properties are very powerful and well understood from the mathematical point of view but, perhaps surprisingly, they have not been so far fully exploited for statistical modelling so this project this comprises a very promising new tool. The project will look at both methodological and computational aspects as well as univariate, multivariate and regression modelling.</description>
